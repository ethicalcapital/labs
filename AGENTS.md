# Ethical Capital Labs

## Overview

Ethical Capital Labs (labs.ethicic.com) is an experimental platform for educational tools and financial simulations. These tools help users explore financial concepts through interactive visualization and modeling, without providing personalized investment advice.

## Purpose

Labs serves as a space for:

1. **Educational Experiments**: Interactive tools that make complex financial concepts accessible
2. **Concept Visualization**: Turning abstract financial principles into tangible, visual experiences
3. **Self-Directed Learning**: Empowering users to explore scenarios and understand relationships between financial variables

**Important**: Labs tools are educational experiments only. They do not constitute investment advice, and users should consult qualified professionals before making financial decisions.

## Current Experiments

### Portfolio Strategy Simulator

Our first experiment explores how different investment strategy combinations affect portfolio outcomes over time. Users can:

- Model accumulation and withdrawal phases
- Visualize the impact of strategy mixing on volatility
- Explore tax-efficient withdrawal sequences
- Test various market scenarios

The simulator demonstrates general principles rather than providing specific recommendations.

## Design Philosophy

### Learning Through Interaction

Research shows users retain 95% of information from interactive experiences vs 10% from text. Our tools prioritize:

- **Visual-First Design**: Complex data presented through intuitive charts and animations
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple mode for basics, advanced mode for deeper exploration
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate visualization of how changes affect outcomes

### Brand Alignment

Labs follows the same brand system defined for the primary site in
`~/ethicic-site/_brand.yml`. All projects should:

- Use the shared font stack (`Outfit` for headings, `Raleway` for body copy)
- Rely on the design tokens in `public/assets/css/labs.css` for colors, spacing,
  panel styles, and buttons instead of ad-hoc Tailwind classes
- Preserve the top navigation layout (logo, key experiment links, GitHub, “Visit
  Ethical Capital”) so movement between labs and the main site feels seamless
- Include the canonical purple footer with disclaimer language plus links to
  Disclosures, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use. Copy the markup in
  `public/index.html` to avoid divergence and never add standalone disclaimer
  sections elsewhere on a page.

### Experimental Approach

Labs tools are experiments in financial education. We:

- Test new ways to communicate financial concepts
- Iterate based on user interaction patterns
- Explore the boundary between education and engagement
- Build with transparency about limitations and assumptions

### No Advice, Just Understanding

Every tool clearly states:

- Results are hypothetical illustrations
- Assumptions may not match real-world conditions
- Professional consultation is needed for personal decisions
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

## Technical Framework

### Core Principles

- **Client-Side Only**: All calculations happen in the browser, no data is collected
- **Open Assumptions**: All parameters and assumptions are visible and adjustable
- **Reproducible Results**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **No Black Boxes**: Calculation methods are documented and explainable

### Implementation Standards

- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG)
- Progressive enhancement
- No required authentication
- Privacy-preserving (no tracking)
- Use `public/assets/css/labs.css` for shared tokens/components. Extend it when
  adding new UI patterns so future experiments start from the same vocabulary.

## Research Foundation

Our experiments draw from established financial research while acknowledging limitations:

### Sources We Reference

- Academic literature on portfolio theory
- Published research on withdrawal strategies
- Behavioral finance studies on decision-making
- Data visualization best practices

### How We Apply Research

- Simplify complex models for educational purposes
- Show ranges of outcomes, not predictions
- Emphasize uncertainty and variability
- Demonstrate concepts, not prescribe solutions

## User Guidelines

### What Labs Tools Can Do

- Help visualize financial concepts
- Demonstrate relationships between variables
- Provide frameworks for thinking about decisions
- Offer starting points for professional discussions

### What Labs Tools Cannot Do

- Provide personalized recommendations
- Guarantee accuracy for individual situations
- Replace professional financial advice
- Predict actual market outcomes

## Experimental Nature

Labs is explicitly experimental. This means:

1. **Tools May Change**: We iterate based on learning what works
2. **Features May Break**: Experiments sometimes fail, and that's okay
3. **Ideas May Not Scale**: Not everything becomes a production tool
4. **Feedback is Welcome**: User input shapes future experiments

## Privacy & Data

Labs tools are designed for privacy:

- No user accounts required
- No personal data collection
- Local storage only (browser-based)
- No server-side processing
- Anonymous usage patterns only

## Future Experiments

Potential areas for exploration:

- **Behavioral Finance**: Tools exploring cognitive biases in financial decisions
- **Risk Visualization**: New ways to understand and compare risks
- **Goal Planning**: Frameworks for thinking about financial objectives
- **Tax Concepts**: Interactive demonstrations of tax strategies
- **Market Mechanics**: Visualizing how markets and investments work

Each experiment will maintain our core principle: education through interaction, not advice.

## Disclaimers

All Labs tools include clear disclaimers:

> This is an educational tool providing hypothetical scenarios only. Results are not guarantees or predictions. The tool makes simplifying assumptions that may not reflect your situation. Always consult qualified professionals before making financial decisions.

## Contributing & Feedback

Labs is about learning together. We welcome:

- Suggestions for new experiments
- Feedback on existing tools
- Bug reports and usability issues
