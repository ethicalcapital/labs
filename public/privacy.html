          <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Invest Vegan LLC DBA Ethical Capital ("Ethical Capital," "we," or
            "us") handles information collected through the Ethical Capital Labs experiments available at
            labs.ethicic.com. These tools are educational prototypes and are not investment advice.
          </p>
          <p class="home-hero__meta">Last updated: February 7, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <article class="labs-panel labs-policy">
          <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            Ethical Capital operates the Labs platform from 90 N 400 E, Provo, UT 84606, USA as an investment
            adviser registered in Utah. You can reach us at <a href="mailto:hello@ethicic.com">hello@ethicic.com</a>
            or +1 347 625 9000.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
          <h3>Email subscriptions</h3>
          <p>
            When you join our Labs release list, we collect your email address along with optional tags and source
            metadata. Submissions are sent to Buttondown (our email service provider) and, when configured, to Less
            Annoying CRM (LACRM) so we can manage follow-up. We also store a hashed version of your email in our
            Cloudflare KV namespace so we can monitor sign-up volume and troubleshoot delivery.
          </p>
          <h3>Voluntary feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Certain tools invite you to share anonymized usage details—such as venue, audience, and outcome notes—to
            improve future iterations. We ask you not to include personal or sensitive information. If the feedback
            API is unavailable, the tool will prompt you to download the JSON locally instead of transmitting it.
          </p>
          <h3>Support communications</h3>
          <p>
            When you email or otherwise contact us, we collect the information you provide (such as name, email
            address, and message content) to respond and document the inquiry.
          </p>
          <h3>Usage data</h3>
          <p>
            Our hosting provider, Cloudflare Pages, logs standard technical information (IP address, user agent, and
            error diagnostics) when you access Labs. We use these logs for security, performance monitoring, and to
            diagnose issues.
          </p>
          <h3>Local storage</h3>
          <p>
            We use browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) to remember that you acknowledged educational
            disclaimers or to keep interface state on your device. This information stays in your browser unless you
            clear it.</p>

          <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Deliver newsletters and product updates you request.</li>
            <li>Respond to questions, feedback, and support requests.</li>
            <li>Monitor platform performance, security, and abuse.</li>
            <li>
              Improve Labs experiments by reviewing aggregated, consented feedback and ensuring educational framing
              remains compliant.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. How we share information</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell your information. We share it only with service providers who help us operate Labs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Buttondown:</strong> manages email distribution and stores subscriber lists.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Less Annoying CRM:</strong> tracks follow-up for prospective client conversations when
              credentials are configured.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloudflare:</strong> provides hosting, security, and telemetry for Labs and our API endpoints.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may also disclose information if required by law, regulation, or valid legal process, or if we believe
            disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or investigate potential violations of our terms.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain subscription records and support correspondence for as long as reasonably necessary to maintain
            the relationship or comply with legal obligations. Hashed email telemetry in KV is retained for trend
            analysis and deleted during periodic maintenance. Aggregated feedback is stored only with your consent and
            reviewed to improve the tools.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Your choices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You can unsubscribe from Labs emails at any time using the link in each message.</li>
            <li>You may request deletion of your subscription records or feedback by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@ethicic.com">hello@ethicic.com</a>.</li>
            <li>You can clear local storage in your browser to remove saved preferences.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Labs is designed for adults involved in institutional investment discussions and is not directed to
            children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Updates to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy as Labs evolves. Material changes will be dated and posted on this page.
            Continued use of the platform after an update signifies acceptance of the revised policy.
