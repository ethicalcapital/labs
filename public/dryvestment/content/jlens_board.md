# Divestment Financial Impact: A Balanced Assessment

## The Question Before Us

Will BDS-related divestment materially harm endowment returns?

## What the Research Shows

### The JLens/ADL Analysis

- **Claim:** $33.2 billion foregone returns over 10 years
- **Method:** Excluded 38 companies from index, measured performance gap
- **Finding:** 1.8% annual underperformance (11.1% vs 12.9% returns)

### Methodological Considerations

The JLens study acknowledges that BDS targeting "changes rapidly" but applies a 2024 exclusion list to the entire 2014-2024 period. This approach, while producing a clear numerical result, may not reflect the experience of investors making decisions in real time with available information.

The study does not disclose its data sources or rebalancing methodology, making independent verification challenging. This limits our ability to assess whether the implementation tested reflects institutional best practices.

### Institutional Experience

**Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund**

- The world's largest sovereign fund ($1.4 trillion) excludes 180+ companies
- Achieved 13.1% returns in 2024 while maintaining exclusions
- Reports tracking error of only 0.3-0.5% relative to benchmark
- Attributes +0.44% of cumulative returns to exclusion decisions

**University Implementations**

- UC System ($126B): Completed fossil fuel divestment as "financial risk management"
- Oxford: Reduced fossil fuel exposure from 8.5% to 0.6%, maintained growth
- Cambridge, Stanford, Georgetown: Implementing exclusions within risk parameters

### Academic Consensus

A review of peer-reviewed studies spanning 90 years of market data finds:

- Divestment "does not significantly impair financial performance" (Trinks & Scholtens, 2018)
- Professional optimization can reduce tracking error by 80-90% (EDHEC, 2023)
- Impact typically measured in basis points, not percentage points

## Key Insight: The JLens Implementation Would Be Malpractice

The JLens study tests an implementation with tracking error of 1.64%â€”roughly equal to their claimed underperformance. This suggests they modeled incompetent execution rather than professional management.

**No fiduciary could legally implement divestment this way:**

**What JLens Appears to Have Tested:**

- Remove stocks, make "no other adjustments"
- Tracking error: ~1.64% (equals their claimed loss)
- Potential cash drag: Up to 32% uninvested
- Result: Would trigger beneficiary lawsuits

**What Professional Managers Actually Do:**

- Factor-neutral optimization and rebalancing
- Tracking error: ~0.3-0.5% (Norway's actual result)
- Full investment: All proceeds immediately redeployed
- Result: Minimal performance impact

**The study cannot be replicated** because JLens won't disclose:

- Data sources
- Rebalancing methodology
- What "no other adjustments" means
- How they weighted remaining holdings

Non-replicable results are invalid in both academic and investment contexts.

## Fiduciary Considerations

As fiduciaries, boards should consider:

1. **Risk Management:** Can exclusions be implemented within acceptable tracking error limits?
2. **Professional Implementation:** Will portfolio management employ optimization techniques?
3. **Stakeholder Alignment:** How do exclusions align with institutional mission and stakeholder expectations?
4. **Performance Monitoring:** What governance ensures ongoing assessment of impact?

## Conclusion

The $33.2 billion projection is invalid because:

1. The methodology cannot be replicated or verified
2. The implementation tested would constitute fiduciary malpractice
3. The tracking error (1.64%) essentially equals the claimed underperformance

Real-world evidence from Norway ($1.4T), UC ($126B), and others demonstrates that professionally managed divestment has minimal impact when properly implemented.

**For Fiduciaries:** Any trustee considering the JLens study should demand:

- Complete methodology disclosure enabling replication
- Evidence the approach meets professional standards
- Comparison with actual institutional implementations

Until then, the study should be disregarded as non-credible advocacy rather than research.
