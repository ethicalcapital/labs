# Fiduciary Playbook: Norway Model in a Box

## Why Boards Need This

- Turns "divest" into a governance motion with tracking-error discipline.
- Shows trustees how to deliver exclusions without breaching prudence.
- Mirrors how NBIM, PFZW, and UC Regents structure conduct screens.

## Core Decision Framework

1. **Mandate & Guardrails**
   - Adopt written conduct criteria that reference international law + credible evidence sources.
   - Set a **tracking-error budget (≤30 bps)** and require factor/sector neutrality.
   - Delegate execution to CIO/consultants while retaining policy oversight.
2. **Phased Implementation**
   - Immediate: stop new purchases, log current exposure.
   - In 30–60 days: exit targeted holdings via orderly trading schedule (avoid divestment shock).
   - Quarterly: certify reinvestment into benchmark-aligned replacements.
3. **Reporting & Transparency**
   - Publish exclusion rationale, evidence citations, and guardrails.
   - Require quarterly one-page dashboards (tracking error, factor exposure, progress).
   - Create appeals/exception process with time limits and public log.

## Implementation Checklist for Staff

- Update IPS / investment policy statement with conduct language + TE budget.
- Instruct index/active managers to load exclusion list + optimization constraints.
- Coordinate consultant to run pre/post analytics (tracking error, factor tilts, liquidity).
- Document phased trade plan and compliance attestations.
- Schedule annual policy review plus event-driven updates (align with AFSC/UN cadence).

## Evidence Trustees Can Cite

- **NBIM (Norway) 2024 Report** – 0.3–0.5% tracking error; exclusions added +0.44% cumulative return.
- **UC Regents 2020 Fossil Fuel Divestment** – expressly labelled "financial risk management".
- **EDHEC 2023 Optimisation Study** – professional rebalancing cuts TE by 80–90% vs naive exclusions.
- **Ethical Capital Screening Policy** – shows how inputs → enablers → thumbprint keep process explainable.

## How to Use in the Builder Brief

- **Opening / Key Points** – reference the TE budget + phased plan to reassure fiduciary focus.
- **Counters** – drop "divestment hurts returns" claims by citing NBIM/UC + guardrails.
- **Next Steps** – convert into action items: adopt conduct policy, mandate optimisation, publish dashboard.
- Attach with JLENS rebuttal for full fiduciary packet.
