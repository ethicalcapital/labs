# Performance Reality Check: What Actually Happens

## Bottom Line

- Professionally managed exclusions track benchmarks within **basis points**, not percentage points.
- Large institutions publish the data: divestment done right protects return integrity.
- Use this sheet to neutralize "but performance" pushback immediately.

## Institutional Scorecard

| Institution | Scope | Return Impact | Risk Controls |
|-------------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **NBIM (Norway)** | 180+ exclusions (conduct & product) | +0.44% cumulative contribution since inception | Tracking error held at 0.3–0.5%; factor-neutral optimisation |
| **UC Regents** | Fossil fuel divestment (2020) | CIO framed as "financial risk management"; objectives met | Consultant oversight + phased exit |
| **PFZW / KLP / AkademikerPension** | Settlement-related exclusions | Report neutral-to-positive impact | Vendor optimisation + quarterly reviews |

## Why Naïve Studies Fail

- **Static lists applied retroactively** (e.g., JLens) ignore point-in-time information sets.
- **“No other adjustments”** = fiduciary malpractice: cash drag, sector concentration, missing rebalancing.
- **Tracking error parity** with claimed losses proves the model was incompetent.

## Implementation Practices that Preserve Returns

- Set explicit tracking-error guardrail (≤30 bps) and require factor/sector neutrality.
- Reinvest promptly to avoid cash drag; use screened indexes or optimisation overlays.
- Phase trades (30–60 days) with compliance sign-off to avoid market impact.
- Monitor via quarterly analytics (tracking error, factor deltas, contribution to return).

## Supporting Research

- **Trinks & Scholtens (2018)** – Divestment "does not significantly impair" performance across 90 years.
- **EDHEC (2023)** – Optimisation cuts tracking error 80–90% versus naive exclusions.
- **Oxford Sustainable Finance Initiative** – Stigma + primary-market effects move cost of capital.

## Deploying in Briefs

- Pair with the JLENS rebuttal: open with this page, then dismantle their math.
- Drop scorecard bullets into Key Points and Counters for quick authority.
- Cite best-practice steps under Next Steps to prove activists are asking for professional execution.
