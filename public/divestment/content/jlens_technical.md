# Technical Review: JLens/ADL Divestment Impact Study

## Executive Summary

The JLens study estimates $33.2 billion in foregone returns from BDS-related divestment. While this analysis raises important questions about fiduciary duty, several methodological limitations significantly affect the reliability of its conclusions.

## Key Methodological Concerns

### 1. Temporal Inconsistency

The study acknowledges (p. 8): *"This limitation highlights the need for ongoing monitoring and regular updates to any BDS-related company lists, as the landscape can change rapidly in response to geopolitical events, corporate actions, and evolving activist strategies."*

However, the methodology applies a static 2024 exclusion list retroactively across the entire 2014-2024 period. Several organizations cited as sources for the exclusion list were not operational during the early years of the study period:

- Don't Buy into Occupation Coalition: Formed January 2021
- OHCHR Database: First published February 2020
- Multiple company additions to boycott lists: Post-2020

This would not reflect actual investor experience.

### 2. Portfolio Construction Failures

The study states: "38 companies in the BDS Top Targets List were excluded in the VettaFi Excl. BDS Top Targets index and no other adjustments were made to the index."

This appears to indicate one or more of the following malpractice-level errors:

- **Cash drag:** Proceeds from excluded securities (32.3% of market cap) potentially not reinvested
- **No rebalancing:** Failing to redistribute weights after removing major index constituents
- **Sector concentration:** No adjustment for removing entire sector exposures (technology, defense)
- **No optimization:** Tracking error of 1.64% annually—essentially equal to claimed underperformance
- **Static implementation:** No quarterly rebalancing despite acknowledged "rapid changes"

The study provides no transparency on:

- What "no other adjustments" means in practice
- The specific data provider for security returns
- Whether dividends were proportionally reinvested

**This lack of transparency invalidates the study's claims.** Non-replicable results have no standing in finance or academia.

### 3. Implementation Would Constitute Fiduciary Malpractice

The approach tested would expose any fiduciary to legal liability:

- **Tracking error of 1.64% annually** is itself nearly the entire claimed underperformance
- **No professional manager** would implement divestment without optimization
- **Any trustee** approving this approach would face beneficiary lawsuits
- **Any consultant** recommending this implementation would lose their license

Professional portfolio management requires:

- Factor-neutral optimization to minimize tracking error (<0.5% target)
- Sector rebalancing to maintain diversification
- Quarterly reallocation as exclusion lists evolve
- Documentation of prudent process

The JLens approach violates every principle of competent investment management.

## Empirical Context

### Institutional Evidence

**Norway's Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG)**

- Assets: $1.4 trillion
- Exclusions: 180+ companies
- Tracking error: 0.3-0.5%
- Cumulative impact: +0.44% (positive contribution from exclusions)

**University of California System**

- Assets: $126 billion
- Action: Complete fossil fuel divestment (May 2020)
- Rationale: "Financial risk management decision"
- Outcome: Objectives met without performance degradation

### Academic Literature

Multiple peer-reviewed studies provide context:

- **Trinks & Scholtens (2018):** Analysis of 1927-2016 data finds divestment "does not significantly impair financial performance"
- **Plantinga & Scholtens (2021):** 40-year study finds differences of "a few basis points"
- **EDHEC (2023):** Professional optimization reduces tracking error by 80-90%

## Technical Observations

### Concentration Risk

The excluded companies represent 32.3% of index market capitalization, heavily concentrated in technology sector leaders that drove 2014-2024 performance. This concentration in recently outperforming securities during a specific market regime raises questions about:

- Sample period dependency
- Generalizability to other time periods
- Mean reversion possibilities

### Benchmark Selection

The use of VettaFi US Equity Large-Cap 500 Index rather than S&P 500 introduces:

- Additional tracking variance
- Reduced comparability with institutional benchmarks
- Challenges in independent verification

## Constructive Considerations

1. **Point-in-Time Analysis:** Future research could benefit from using exclusion lists as they existed at each historical point, reflecting actual investor information sets.

2. **Multiple Implementation Scenarios:** Comparing naive exclusion with professionally optimized approaches would provide a range of potential outcomes.

3. **Transparency Enhancement:** Providing full methodological details would enable replication and strengthen confidence in findings.

4. **Risk-Adjusted Metrics:** Including Sharpe ratios, information ratios, and tracking error analysis would contextualize absolute return differences.

## Conclusion

The JLens study's $33.2 billion estimate is invalid due to:

1. **Fundamental non-replicability:** Without disclosing data sources, rebalancing methodology, or calculation details, this claim cannot be verified by any third party. In academic or investment contexts, non-replicable results are considered void.

2. **Implementation that would constitute malpractice:** The approach tested—with tracking error of 1.64% annually (roughly equal to the claimed underperformance)—would expose any fiduciary to legal liability.

The study provides several possible explanations for its extreme results, none defensible:

- Made "no other adjustments" after removing one-third of market cap
- Used no sector rebalancing after removing concentrated positions
- Applied no optimization to minimize tracking error
- Failed to reinvest proceeds from divested securities
- Ignored quarterly rebalancing standards

Any of these approaches would constitute professional negligence.

## Minimum Standards for Credible Analysis

Future analysis of divestment impacts should not be considered without:

- **Point-in-time exclusion lists** reflecting realistic investor experience
- **Full methodological transparency** enabling independent replication
- **Multiple implementation scenarios** from naive to professionally optimized
- **Multi-period analysis** avoiding cherry-picked market regimes

Without these elements, studies should be recognized as advocacy documents rather than research.
