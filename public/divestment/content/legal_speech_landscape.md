# Legal & Speech Landscape: Protected, Compliant, Defensible

## Core Message

- Conduct-based divestment is **lawful, fiduciary-aligned, and protected speech**.
- Courts have repeatedly affirmed the right to boycott and struck down overbroad anti-BDS statutes.
- This sheet helps activists move past “is this antisemitic/illegal?” paralysis.

## Antisemitism Claims vs Policy Reality

- **Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism** – boycotts targeting state conduct are *not* antisemitic.
- Jewish-led groups (Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow) back conduct screens grounded in human rights.
- Emphasise one universal standard: any issuer, any country, same criteria → no singling-out.

## Constitutional & Statutory Precedent

- **NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware (458 U.S. 886)** – boycotts are core political speech protected by the First Amendment.
- **Baldassi v. France (ECHR)** – European Court affirmed BDS advocacy as protected expression.
- **Koontz v. Watson**, **Amawi v. Pflugerville ISD**, **Jordahl v. Brnovich** – U.S. courts enjoined anti-BDS contracting laws that penalised speech.
- Revised state statutes now target procurement contracts; conduct-based investment policies remain lawful.

## Policy Design Guardrails

- Root exclusions in international humanitarian law + UN Guiding Principles.
- Apply globally; include legal review and best-efforts language (critical for treasuries/municipal funds).
- Document rationale, evidence, and appeals process to demonstrate transparency and avoid viewpoint discrimination claims.

## Messaging Moves

- “This is about risk management and rule of law.”
- “We apply one standard everywhere.”
- “Speech is protected” – cite Claiborne & Baldassi whenever challenged.

## Using in the Brief

- Attach to counters addressing antisemitism or legality objections.
- Reference guardrails in Next Steps (e.g., legal review, public criteria, universal standard statement).
- Pair with the Fiduciary Playbook and Performance Reality Check to cover trust, returns, and compliance.
