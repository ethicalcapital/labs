# Sloane Video Talking Points

- Emphasize that divestment is active management: we exercise CIO discretion and take responsibility for deliberate portfolio choices.
- Highlight that investors must request honest, transparent reporting from consultants about implementation limits (e.g., where broad market funds remain).
- Explain why activist intelligence (AFSC, UN data) provides specialist insight, while mainstream ESG vendors handle delivery infrastructureâ€”together they form the complete toolkit.
- Reinforce that ignoring credible violations is itself political; managing risk in mission-aligned ways is part of fiduciary duty.
